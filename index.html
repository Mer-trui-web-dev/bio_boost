    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am an office administrator, newly exposed to the world of Web Development and Coding. I started my career as a legal
        drafter for local government and obtained a diploma in Human Resources Management when I relocated to Canada.
        I am honored to be one of Skillhat's Diverse tech Talent Program Scholarship and hope to continue on this journey 
        even after the program comes to an end. <br> <br>
        My interest for Tech overall comes from my love for the Internet and all developments that we have experienced over the past few years.
        The most I have known about being in the online space has been self-thought, but I have always been curious to expand my skills.
        Why would a legal / HR professional would want to learn code? Because technology is a part of every industry we know.
        Human Resources technologies are developing in rapid speed and having this knowledge gives me a competitive advantage.</p>
