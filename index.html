        <div class="body">I am an office administrator, newly exposed to the world of Web Development and Coding. I started my career as a legal
            drafter for local government and obtained a diploma in Human Resources Management when I relocated to Canada.
            I am honored to be one of Skillhat's Diverse tech Talent Program Scholarship and hope to continue on this journey 
            even after the program comes to an end.
            My interest for Tech overall comes from my love for the Internet and all developments that we have experienced over the past few years.
            The most I have known about being in the online space has been self-thought, but I have always been curious to expand my skills.
            Why would a legal / HR professional would want to learn code? Because technology is a part of every industry we know.
            Human Resources technologies are developing in rapid speed and having this knowledge gives me a competitive advantage.</div>
