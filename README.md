# bio_boost
This repository is created to rebuild and upgrade my Bio and Portfolio.
The final result can be viewed at my GitHub pages, founde here: https://mer-trui-web-dev.github.io/bio_boost/

The project is based upon the deployment of an initial bio page, found here: https://mer-trui-web-dev.github.io/merfirstrepo/
The initial bio page was reveiwed and additional HTML and CSS elements were added to create a more elevated portfolio.
For the header and footer, a flex box approach was used to include divs such as the profile image, heading and lists.
For the main part of the main area a grid approach was taken to fit all div elements and sections aligned.
The images were also placed into a seperate grid to achieve the desired layout.

This repository is still in progress and as such the used coding will be changed and developed overtime.
Please cause caution in the use of coding.
